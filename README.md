**Schizophrenia Detection Using Microbiome Data, A Causal AI Approach** 
<br>
<br>
The objectives of the project are:
<br>
a. To identify a feature set of microbiomes that have a causal relationship with schizophrenia using Markov Blanket approach with causal AI
<br>
b. To develop a Machine Learning approach for schizophrenia classification using Random Forest (RF)
<br>
c. To evaluate the performance of the Machine Learning (ML) model using K-fold cross-validation and classification evaluation metrics, which include Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrix, and classification report
